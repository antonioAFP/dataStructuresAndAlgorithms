Data Structures and Algorithms

List Operations:
	- add/append(element), add element at the end of the list
	- add/insert(index, element), add element at a given index, shiftting to the rigth
	- remove(index)
	- set/replace(index, element)
	- get(index)
	- search/contains(key)
	- sort()
	
Recursion:   calling face(ascending) and returning face (descending)
	- Tail, calls itself at the ending og the function
	- Head, calls itself at the beggining of the function
	- Tree, calls itself two times
	- Indirect, calls another functions so in some point it is called
	- Nested, fun( fun(n - 1), the function calls itself as parameter
